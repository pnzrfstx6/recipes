# recipes
My second project was pretty more difficult and challenging than the first one.
I will do my best to make this happen! 

In this project, i will apply the skills I have learned until here, elaborating an recipe website. I will use html based language to set up the website.


In this Website, i will explain how to cook a delicious Brigadeiro, like my girlfriend always
do. The Jeitinho Brasileiro will be used to prepare this so make sure that you are antenado in the brazilian culture.
